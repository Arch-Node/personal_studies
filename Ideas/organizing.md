# 📢 Organizing Without Leaders  

## 📜 Quick Summary  
✅ **Leaderless networks are harder to dismantle.**  
✅ **Use small, independent cells (3-10 people) for security.**  
✅ **Limit inter-group knowledge to reduce infiltration risks.**  
✅ **Predefine fallback plans & emergency protocols.**  
✅ **Use encrypted tools for safe communication.**  

## 1️⃣ Decentralized Organizing Models  
- **Affinity Groups** – Small independent teams with a shared purpose.  
- **Spokescouncils** – Network of affinity groups with rotating coordinators.  
- **Leaderless Resistance** – No central authority; actions are autonomous.  

## 2️⃣ Security Considerations  
| Security Measure | Purpose | Risk Level |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| **Compartmentalization** | Prevents exposure of entire network | ✅ Very Low |
| **Verification Protocols** | Ensures trusted members only | ✅ Low |
| **Encrypted Communication** | Prevents message interception | ✅ High |

## 3️⃣ Decision-Making Strategies  
- **Consensus-Based Decision Making** – Every member has equal input.  
- **Swarm Tactics** – Rapidly responding to new situations.  
- **Predefined Action Protocols** – Ensures coordination without real-time communication.
