# **Project 2025: Abortion & Healthcare Rights**

## **What This Means for America**

Project 2025 includes plans to **severely restrict abortion, defund reproductive healthcare, and privatize public health services**. Supporters argue these policies protect traditional values and reduce government spending, but critics warn they **violate women’s rights, limit access to medical care, and increase health disparities**.

## **1. Proposed Policy Changes**

- **Revoking FDA Approval of Abortion Medications** – The initiative seeks to reverse the FDA's approval of mifepristone and misoprostol, effectively banning medication abortions, which account for approximately 63% of all abortions in the U.S. ([Time](https://time.com/7262145/medication-abortion-guttmacher-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Enforcing the Comstock Act** – Project 2025 aims to rigorously apply the Comstock Act to prohibit the mailing of abortion pills and related medical equipment, potentially leading to criminal prosecution of both senders and recipients.

- **Restricting Emergency Abortion Care** – The plan allows hospitals to deny emergency, life-saving abortion care to pregnant patients in crisis, thereby limiting access to critical reproductive healthcare services.

- **Defunding Planned Parenthood** – Project 2025 proposes eliminating federal funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood that provide abortion services, further restricting access to reproductive healthcare.

- **Creating a Pregnant Woman Registry** – A Missouri lawmaker has proposed creating a registry of pregnant women deemed "at risk" of seeking abortions. The goal is to track pregnancies and intervene before women terminate their pregnancies, potentially coercing them into continuing unwanted pregnancies.

## **2. Recent Developments**

- **Executive Order 14182** – On January 24, 2025, President Trump signed this order titled "Enforcing the Hyde Amendment," which ends federal funding for elective abortions and revokes prior orders that expanded access to reproductive healthcare. ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025-02175/enforcing-the-hyde-amendment?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Legal Actions Against Abortion Pill Access** – Republican attorneys general from Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas have filed a federal lawsuit aiming to reverse FDA regulations that expanded access to mifepristone, including allowing telehealth prescriptions. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/mifepristone-genbiopro-abortion-pill-case?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Wyoming's Abortion Clinic Closures** – Wyoming's only full-service abortion clinic has ceased providing abortions following new regulations that require such clinics to be licensed as surgical centers.

## **3. Potential Implications**

- **Criminalization of Abortion Services** – Enforcing the Comstock Act could lead to criminal charges against individuals involved in mailing or receiving abortion pills, effectively creating a de facto national abortion ban. ([Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025s-distortion-of-a-reconstruction-era-law-could-enact-a-national-abortion-ban/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Increased Maternal Mortality and Health Risks** – Texas's abortion ban has already led to an increase in severe pregnancy-related infections, including sepsis, due to delays in care. Similar policies under Project 2025 could worsen these health risks nationwide. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-abortion-ban-sepsis-maternal-mortality-analysis))  

- **Impact on Adolescent Pregnancy and Health** – Restricting abortion access disproportionately affects young mothers, increasing the likelihood of health complications, poverty, and long-term socioeconomic disadvantages. ([World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-pregnancy#:~:text=Adolescent%20mothers%20))  

- **Reduced Access to Reproductive Healthcare** – Revoking FDA approval of abortion medications and defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood would significantly limit access to reproductive healthcare services, particularly for marginalized communities. ([Self Magazine](https://www.self.com/story/project-2025-reproductive-health-care?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Legal Conflicts Between States** – The implementation of abortion shield laws in some states to protect providers and patients may lead to interstate legal conflicts, especially as other states impose civil and criminal actions against those facilitating abortions.

## **4. What You Can Do**

- **Support Reproductive Rights Organizations** – Engage with and support organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org)), Planned Parenthood ([Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org)), and the Center for Reproductive Rights ([Center for Reproductive Rights](https://reproductiverights.org)) that advocate for reproductive rights and provide essential services.  

- **Stay Informed and Advocate** – Keep abreast of legislative developments at both state and federal levels. Participate in advocacy efforts, contact your representatives, and voice your support for reproductive healthcare access.  

- **Vote** – Exercise your right to vote in local, state, and national elections to support candidates who uphold reproductive rights and healthcare access.  

By staying informed and actively participating in advocacy, individuals can contribute to the ongoing efforts to protect and promote reproductive healthcare rights.
