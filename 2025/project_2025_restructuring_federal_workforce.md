# **Project 2025: Restructuring the Federal Workforce & Staffing Overhaul**

## **What This Means for America**

Project 2025 includes a plan to **give the president more control over the federal workforce**. This means **removing independent workers and replacing them with political loyalists** while **dismantling protections for civil service employees**. Supporters claim this will increase efficiency, but critics warn it will **lead to corruption, eliminate independent oversight, and politicize government agencies**.

## **1. What Project 2025 Proposes**

**Project 2025 Policy:**  
> "The President must exercise full control over the Executive Branch, ensuring that all agencies align with the administration's policy objectives."

This means:
- **The president could fire thousands of nonpartisan government employees.**  
- **Experts in science, healthcare, and law enforcement could be replaced with political allies.**  
- **Independent agencies like the Department of Justice and the FBI could be weaponized for political purposes.**

## **2. Why This Is a Problem**

- **Removes Neutral Workers** ‚Äì Government employees should work for the **American people**, not a political party. Project 2025 would **make the government less fair** by filling jobs only with those who agree with the president.  
- **No More Independent Oversight** ‚Äì Agencies like the **FBI, IRS, and Department of Justice** are supposed to be fair. If the president controls them completely, he can **use them against his enemies**.  
- **More Corruption** ‚Äì When leaders **pick loyal friends over skilled workers**, government decisions become **more about power and less about serving the people**.

## **3. When This Happened Before**

### **Historical Examples:**  

- **The Spoils System (1800s):** Before civil service reforms, presidents **fired government workers and replaced them with political friends**, leading to **corruption and inefficiency**. The system was so broken that **President James Garfield was assassinated by a man who believed he was owed a government job**. ([History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/spoils-system))  
- **Stalin‚Äôs Government Purges (1930s):** In the Soviet Union, **Joseph Stalin** fired and jailed thousands of government officials, replacing them with people **who were loyal to him instead of experts**. This led to **poor decision-making and massive economic failures**. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/stalin_purges_01.shtml))  
- **Nixon‚Äôs "Saturday Night Massacre" (1973):** President **Richard Nixon** tried to control the Department of Justice by **firing people who were investigating him**. This led to a **constitutional crisis**, and Nixon resigned soon after. ([History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/1970s/saturday-night-massacre))

- **Government decisions would be made based on politics, not expertise.**  
- **Corruption and government abuses would increase.**  
- **The president could fire anyone in government who disagrees with him.**  
- **Laws meant to protect fairness and honesty could disappear.**  
- **The government could be used to attack opponents instead of serving the people.**

- **Contact Congress** ‚Äì Demand legislative protections for independent government employees and agencies.
- **Stay Aware and Report Political Interference** ‚Äì If you work in or follow government agencies, report unethical staffing changes.
- **Vote for Leaders Who Oppose Government Purges** ‚Äì Elections impact how federal staffing policies are created and enforced.
