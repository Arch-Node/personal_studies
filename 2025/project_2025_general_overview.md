## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **More presidential power** ‚Äì The president could **fire government workers at will** and replace them with political loyalists.
- **Fewer rights for individuals** ‚Äì Civil rights, including LGBTQ+ protections, reproductive rights, and voting rights, could be **rolled back or removed entirely**.
- **A weakened democracy** ‚Äì Government institutions designed to **check executive power** would be dismantled.
- **Increased control over education** ‚Äì Public schools would be **forced to follow ideological curriculums**, banning discussions of race, gender, and scientific research.
- **Privatization of public services** ‚Äì Healthcare, education, and government functions would be **sold to private companies**, making them **more expensive and less accessible**.
