# **Project 2025: LGBTQ+ Rights Under Attack**

## **What This Means for America**

Project 2025, spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and supported by over 100 conservative organizations, proposes a comprehensive plan that could significantly impact LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.

## **1. Proposed Policy Changes**

- **Redefinition of Sex in Federal Policies** – The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has introduced a new definition of sex that excludes transgender and intersex individuals, categorizing sex strictly based on immutable biological characteristics. This redefinition could limit access to healthcare and other services for LGBTQ+ individuals. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbc-out/biden-admin-rule-would-protect-trans-people-homeless-shelter-disc-rcna117733))  

- **Rescinding Non-Discrimination Protections** – Project 2025 advocates for the reversal of regulations that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, potentially allowing federally funded programs and contractors to deny services to LGBTQ+ individuals. ([Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/hrc-responds-to-latest-anti-lgbtq-bill-proposed-by-house-republicans))  

- **Elimination of LGBTQ+ Equity Initiatives** – The plan recommends that the HHS Secretary shift focus away from LGBTQ+ equity initiatives, suggesting that current policies subsidize single motherhood and disincentivize traditional family structures. ([Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/gender/report/project-2025-the-right-path-americas-future))  

- **Banning Transgender Individuals from Military Service** – Project 2025 calls for the reinstatement of a military policy that bans transgender individuals from serving in the armed forces, reversing current policies that allow for their service.

## **2. Recent Developments**

- **State-Level Rollbacks** – Iowa's Governor signed a bill removing gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code, making Iowa the first state to enact such a law. This legislation, effective July 1, 2025, defines male and female based on reproductive organs at birth, effectively negating the recognition of transgender identities. ([Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/20/iowa-governor-signs-bill-removing-transgender-protections/70987150007/))  

- **Federal Policy Shifts** – The Social Security Administration and other federal agencies have revised LGBTQ+ web pages, removing references to transgender and intersex individuals, signaling a broader federal shift in LGBTQ+ recognition and protections.

## **3. Potential Implications**

- **Healthcare Access** – Transgender and non-binary individuals may face increased difficulty in accessing medical care, including gender-affirming treatments and emergency services.  
- **Employment and Housing Discrimination** – Without federal protections, LGBTQ+ individuals could be legally denied jobs and housing based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.  
- **Educational Censorship** – Schools may be prohibited from teaching about LGBTQ+ history and identities, erasing representation from curricula.  
- **Military Exclusion** – Transgender individuals who are currently serving may face discharge, and new applicants may be barred from enlisting, reducing military diversity and inclusivity.  
- **Legal Challenges** – The rollback of protections may lead to increased legal battles for LGBTQ+ rights at the state and federal levels.

## **4. What You Can Do**

- **Support LGBTQ+ Rights Organizations** – Engage with and support organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign ([HRC](https://www.hrc.org)), Lambda Legal ([Lambda Legal](https://www.lambdalegal.org)), and the National Center for Transgender Equality ([NCTE](https://transequality.org)) that advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and provide essential resources.  

- **Stay Informed and Advocate** – Keep up with legislative developments at the state and federal levels. Participate in advocacy efforts, contact your representatives, and voice your support for LGBTQ+ protections.  

- **Vote** – Exercise your right to vote in local, state, and national elections to support candidates who uphold LGBTQ+ rights and equal protections.  

By staying informed and actively participating in advocacy, individuals can contribute to the ongoing efforts to protect and promote LGBTQ+ rights.
