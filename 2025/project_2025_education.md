# **Project 2025: Education Under Attack**

## **What This Means for America**

Project 2025, a comprehensive conservative initiative, proposes significant changes to the U.S. education system that could profoundly impact public education.

## **1. Proposed Policy Changes**

- **Abolishing the Department of Education** – The plan advocates for dismantling the Department of Education, transferring its responsibilities to states and other federal agencies. This move could undermine federal efforts to provide accessible, inclusive, and high-quality public education.

- **Eliminating Title I Funding** – Project 2025 proposes phasing out Title I funding, which supports schools in low-income areas. This could result in the loss of over 180,000 teacher positions and negatively affect the academic outcomes of approximately 2.8 million vulnerable students nationwide. ([Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025s-elimination-of-title-i-funding-would-hurt-students-and-decimate-teaching-positions-in-local-schools/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Defunding Head Start Programs** – The initiative calls for eliminating the Office of Head Start, potentially closing programs that serve about 833,000 low-income children annually, thereby reducing access to early childhood education.

- **Promoting School Vouchers** – Project 2025 supports expanding school voucher programs, allowing public funds to be used for private and religious schooling. Critics argue this could divert necessary funds from public schools and exacerbate educational inequities.

- **Restricting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Initiatives** – The plan aims to dismantle policies promoting DEI, potentially reversing progress made during the civil rights movement and affecting marginalized communities.

- **Revising Civil Rights Enforcement** – Project 2025 seeks to limit federal enforcement of civil rights in schools, transferring responsibilities to the Department of Justice and restricting investigations into discriminatory practices, which could disproportionately affect Black students and other students of color.

## **2. Recent Developments**

- **Executive Order on 'Radical Indoctrination'** – On January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14190, titled "Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling." This order prohibits teaching materials considered anti-American or subversive, including those promoting "gender ideology" or critical race theory. It also reinstated the 1776 Commission, originally created during Trump's first term. ([Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-makes-english-official-language-of-united-states?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Official Language Designation** – President Trump signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States. While it doesn't mandate changes to federal programs, it allows government-funded entities to reduce language accessibility standards, potentially affecting non-English speakers' access to essential services. ([Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-makes-english-official-language-of-united-states?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **State-Level Initiatives** – In Oklahoma, efforts led by State Superintendent Ryan Walters are pushing to diminish the separation of church and state, exemplified by initiatives such as the creation of a Catholic public charter school and plans to place Trump-branded Bibles in classrooms. This movement aligns with Project 2025's agenda to increase school vouchers for private religious schools and create task forces to protect Christian rights.

## **3. Reinterpreting Title IX to Enforce Compliance**

- **Executive Order 14201 – "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"** – On February 5, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." This order seeks to ban transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams, asserting that such participation violates Title IX provisions. The executive order threatens to revoke federal funding from any elementary, secondary, or post-secondary institution that allows transgender girls to play on girls' teams. ([Them](https://www.them.us/story/maine-governor-investigation-donald-trump-department-of-education?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

- **Federal Funding Threats** – The administration has indicated that non-compliance with this executive order could result in the withdrawal of federal funds from educational institutions. This approach leverages Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or education program receiving federal funding, to enforce policies aligning with the administration's interpretation of gender and sex.  

- **Legal Challenges** – These actions have sparked legal disputes. For instance, Maine Governor Janet Mills openly defied the executive order, leading to threats of federal funding withdrawal and subsequent investigations by the U.S. Department of Education into Maine's compliance with Title IX. Governor Mills has vowed to protect the state's legal rights and maintain federal funding for schools, emphasizing that no president has the authority to unilaterally withhold funds appropriated by Congress.

## **4. What You Can Do**

- **Support Public Education Advocacy Groups** – Engage with organizations such as the National Education Association ([NEA](https://www.nea.org)) and the American Federation of Teachers ([AFT](https://www.aft.org)) that advocate for public education and equitable policies.  

- **Stay Informed and Advocate** – Monitor legislative developments at local, state, and federal levels. Participate in advocacy efforts, contact your representatives, and express support for policies that promote equitable and inclusive education.  

- **Participate in Local Education Initiatives** – Get involved with local school boards, parent-teacher associations, and community organizations to support public schools and influence educational policies.  

By staying informed and actively participating in advocacy, individuals can contribute to the ongoing efforts to protect and promote equitable and inclusive education for all students.
